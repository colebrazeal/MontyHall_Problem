        <p class="body-text">
            The Monty Hall game involves a contestant choosing one of three doors, 
            behind one of which is a car and behind the others are goats. 
            After the initial choice, the host, who knows what's behind the doors, 
            opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The contestant is then given the option to either stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door. 
            The puzzle explores which strategy—sticking or switching—gives the contestant a better chance of winning the car.
